# Sales Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing sales data from a fictional e-commerce platform and generating key visualizations. The analysis is based on a set of common SQL queries typically used for sales reporting.

## Project Overview

This project aims to extract meaningful insights from sales, customer, and product data. It processes CSV files to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average order value, customer purchasing habits, and product category performance. The insights are then presented using data visualizations (bar charts and line plots).

## Data Sources

The analysis uses the following CSV files:
- [cite_start]`orders.csv`: Contains order details including `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `revenue`. 
- [cite_start]`customers.csv`: Contains customer information such as `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, and `signup_date`. 
- [cite_start]`products.csv`: Contains product details including `product_id`, `name`, `category`, and `price`. 
- [cite_start]`order_items.csv`: Contains details about items within each order, including `order_item_id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, and `price`. 

## Analysis Performed

The Python script performs the following analytical tasks, mimicking common SQL queries:

1.  [cite_start]**Total Revenue**: Calculates the sum of all revenue from the `orders` table. 
2.  [cite_start]**Average Order Revenue**: Determines the average revenue per order. 
3.  [cite_start]**Total Orders Per Customer**: Counts the number of orders placed by each customer. 
4.  [cite_start]**Top 5 Customers by Revenue**: Identifies the customers who have generated the most total revenue. 
5.  [cite_start]**Revenue Per Product Category**: Calculates the total revenue for each product category based on order items. 
6.  [cite_start]**Monthly Revenue Trends**: Aggregates total revenue by month to show temporal sales patterns. 
7.  [cite_start]**Handling Nulls**: Identifies customers with missing email addresses. 

## Visualizations

The script generates the following visualizations:

-   **Top 5 Customers by Total Revenue**: A bar chart showing the highest-spending customers.
-   **Revenue Per Product Category**: A bar chart illustrating the revenue contribution of each product category.
-   **Monthly Revenue Trends**: A line plot depicting the total revenue over different months.

## How to Run

To run the analysis and generate the visualizations:

1.  **Clone the repository** (if this were a real GitHub repo, you'd clone it here) or ensure all the data CSV files and the Python script are in the same directory.
2.  **Install the required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  **Execute the Python script**:
    ```bash
    python your_analysis_script_name.py
    ```
    (Replace `your_analysis_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script, e.g., `sales_analysis.py`).

The script will print the analysis results to the console and display the generated plots.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   pandas
-   matplotlib
-   seaborn

You can install these using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
